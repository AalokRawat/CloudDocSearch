# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Title: Cloud Document Search Application

### 1. Introduction

The Cloud Document Search Application is a Java application that connects to an online data storage service (e.g.,
Google Drive, Dropbox, S3) using their respective APIs to fetch files stored on the service. It allows users to search
for files based on their content and metadata. The system indexes the content within the files to provide efficient text
search capabilities. This PRD outlines the key features and requirements of the system.

### 2. Use Cases

#### 2.1 File Retrieval and Search

**2.1.1 Use Case Description:**

- Users can search for files based on a search term or token.

**2.1.2 User Story:**

- As a user, I want to search for files stored in the online data storage service based on specific keywords or terms.

**2.1.3 Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system shall provide a RESTful API that accepts a search term as input.
- The API shall return a list of files and their HTTP URLs that contain the search term in their content or metadata.
- If no matching files are found, the API shall return an empty result.
- The response shall include file paths and URLs.

**2.1.4 Example:**

- Input: "curl https://<search-service-host>/search?q="c""
- Output: 
  """
  X../File1
  Y../File2
  """

- Input: "curl https://<search-service-host>/search?q="notfound-term""
- Output: Empty

#### 2.2 File Format Handling

**2.2.1 Use Case Description:**

- The system should handle files in various formats such as .csv, .txt, .pdf, or .docx.

**2.2.2 User Story:**

- As a user, I want the system to support a variety of file formats.

**2.2.3 Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system shall be able to fetch and process files in .csv, .txt, .pdf, and .docx formats.
- For files that are not UTF-8 encoded, the system may optionally extract text content using a library like Apache Tika or Tesseract.

#### 2.3 Content Indexing

**2.3.1 Use Case Description:**

- The system should index the content within the fetched files to provide efficient text search capabilities.

**2.3.2 User Story:**

- As a user, I want the system to index the content of files for faster and more accurate search results.

**2.3.3 Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system shall store indexed content and metadata in a suitable data storage system, such as Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL.
- The indexing shall support both file content and file metadata (e.g., file name, type, date, etc.).

### 3. System Components

#### 3.1 Data Storage Service Integration

- The system shall integrate with the chosen online data storage service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, S3) using their APIs.

#### 3.2 File Format Handling

- The system shall support .csv, .txt, .pdf, and .docx file formats.

#### 3.3 Content Indexing

- The system shall use a suitable data storage system (e.g., Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL) for content indexing.

#### 3.4 Search API

- The system shall provide a RESTful API for searching files based on a search term.

#### 3.5 User Interface

- The system shall provide a basic command line or web interface for users to consume the search API and display search results.

### 4. Dependencies

- The system may use third-party libraries such as Apache Tika or Tesseract for text extraction.
- The system will require credentials and permissions to access the chosen online data storage service.

### 5. Performance and Scalability

- The system should be designed to handle a large number of files and provide quick search results.

### 6. Security

- The system should implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and access to the online data storage service.

### 7. Future Enhancements

- In the future, the system can be extended to support additional file formats and data storage services.

### 8. Conclusion

The Online Data Search and Retrieval System aims to provide users with a powerful tool for searching and retrieving files
stored in online data storage services. It will support a variety of file formats, index file content and metadata, and
offer a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system. By meeting these requirements, the system will empower
users to efficiently find and access their files.
